# DD2480G24: CI
Minimum Supported Python Version (MSPV): 3.7
Test Framework: unittest (Python native module)

## Specification
An information specification of the CI server can be found in the `SPEC.md` file.

## Installation
First make sure you are in the root directory of the repository.
Create a virtual environment through `python -m venv venv`.
Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate `activate` script in `venv/bin/`.
Install all dependencies with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Use the `deactivate` command in your terminal when you are done.

## Documentation
Generate the documentation by running `make docs` after [installation](#Installation).
After building the documentation, a PDF is available at `docs/build/pdf`.

This project contains a functioning implementation of a CI server which communicates through the GitHub API and GitHub Webhooks to build the project (tests and syntax checking). The server stores all build outputs  which are accessible as secure endpoints on the server. Upon a new pull request, the server sets a pending status of the commit on GitHub, builds the project, and provides results as well as sets the status depending on the result.

### Detailed building of documentation
Adding New Modules to Sphinx Documentation
To include new modules in the Sphinx documentation, use the following command:

```bash
sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source/ src/
```

This command generates reStructuredText files in the docs/source/ directory, based on the modules found in the src/ directory.

#### Building the Documentation as an HTML Page

To build the documentation into HTML format, follow these steps depending on your operating system:

**For Windows:**

Navigate to the docs directory:

```bash
cd docs
```

Then, run the make batch file:

```bash
.\make.bat html
```

**For Linux:**

Navigate to the docs directory:

```bash
cd docs
```

Then, use the make command:

```bash
make html
```

This process will compile the Sphinx documentation into HTML pages, which can be found in the docs/build/html directory.

#### Generating Documentation as a PDF

To create a PDF version of your Sphinx documentation, we use the following commands:

Navigate to the docs directory:

```bash
cd docs
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
sphinx-build -b pdf source build/pdf
```

This command instructs Sphinx to build the documentation in PDF format.

## Folder structure

The following main folders and files constitute the project:
- DD2480G24-2
    - `docs` Containts build information
    - `src`
        - `build` Containts method executed upon a build request
        - `dummycode` Contains code which can be used to test the CI implementation
        - `logs` Contains all log files for builds
        - `utils` Contains utility functions such as test runner and syntax checker
        - `app.py` Contains main flask application
        - `payload.py` Contains Webhook parser
    - `tests` Contains all tests of the CI server
    - `Makefile` Build commands for local development
    - `README.md`
    - `requirements.txt` Contains all required modules
    - `SERVER.md` Contains information about the host ssh server
    - `SPEC.md` Contains a specification of the CI server


## Testing
The unit testing is based on the Python built in `unittest` framework (https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

To run all tests in a file:
- `python -m unittest <path to testfile>`

## API Endpoints
### Logs
- `GET /logs/<commit_id>`: Returns the logs for the given commit id
- `GET /logs/all`: Returns all logs

The logs are stored in the `logs` directory and are named after the commit id. The logs are stored in the format `logs/<commit_id>.log`. Based on this we can retrieve the logs for a specific commit id. This endpoint will return a dict with the date of the build, the commit id and the log messages.

The `GET /logs/all` endpoint will return a list of all logs in the logs directory.

### Build
- `POST /build`: Endpoint used by the GitHub Webhook to build the project upon a pull request

The build endpoint is used by the GitHub Webhook to trigger a build of the project. The endpoint will be triggered on all commits to the repository. The endpoint will compile the project by running a syntax check and running the tests. The results of the build will be stored in the logs directory. The endpoint will also update the status of the commit on GitHub.

## CI Tools Documentation
### GitHub Webhooks

## GitHub Webhooks
This implementation utilises several webhooks for different purposes, such as handling issue creation and pull requests. 
Currently, the CI server implementation is hosted locally and consequently all internet traffic is tunneled through [ngrok](https://ngrok.com). Any given Webhook in this project has the following characteristics:
- `Payload URL`: The forwarding URL provided by `ngrok`
- `Secret`: Secret message for validation of payload authenticity
- `Content type`: application/json
- `SSL verification`: Enable SSL verification
- `Events`: The event handled by the Webhook

### GitHub API
The GitHub API is used to set the status of a commit during the CI process on the server. 
The implementation requires that the environment variables `BUILD_SECRET` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`
are set, as these are required to verify GitHub webhooks as well as make requests to the
GitHub API. The method `set_status` in `run_build.py` is used to set the status of a commit to either of the
available statuses "pending", "success", "error" or "failure". The implementation follows the 
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/statuses?apiVersion=2022-11-28) under section `Create a commit status`.

## Essence Analysis
Currently the team is working to complete "In Use". The previous lists were 
completed and understood during the previous assignment. However, important
to note is that during this assignment our effectivity has reduced fair bit
on all fronts. This is largely due to, as expected, that this assignment
was not as predefined as the previous and as such we found ourselves figuring
out how to most effectively split up the task. Due to this, it took more time
and effort to fulfill the checklist goals, but towards the end we regained a
lot of the momentum we had previously lost. For future projects we will aim
to remove this reduction in efficiency by preparing the workload and job
specification in more detail before we move on. Furthermore, to complete the
checklists "In Place" and "Working well" the team simply needs more practice,
aside from the previously stated planning.
